// Generated by dart2js (full emitter, strong), the Dart to JavaScript compiler version: 2.0.0.
// The code supports the following hooks:
// dartPrint(message):
//    if this function is defined it is called instead of the Dart [print]
//    method.
//
// dartMainRunner(main, args):
//    if this function is defined, the Dart [main] method will not be invoked
//    directly. Instead, a closure that will invoke [main], and its arguments
//    [args] is passed to [dartMainRunner].
//
// dartDeferredLibraryLoader(uri, successCallback, errorCallback):
//    if this function is defined, it will be called when a deferred library
//    is loaded. It should load and eval the javascript of `uri`, and call
//    successCallback. If it fails to do so, it should call errorCallback with
//    an error.
//
// defaultPackagesBase:
//    Override the location where `package:` uris are resolved from. By default
//    they are resolved under "packages/" from the current window location.
